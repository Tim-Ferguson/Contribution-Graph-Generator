todo: 

Cleanup code in the following ways:

Have it build with a default year (By calling from the page after load)
Cleanup code so its not just one script that runs
Add button for them to choose default color for clicking (or leave it with clicking up a level as they go)
Add button to clear entire year
Add button to let them choose how many contributions will come in at each level
Generate  command they can run from their terminal -> We will need to allow this to be copy pasted or exported somehow



Dream: Add "ascii to graph" so they can write it in if they want without drawing
Add a series of presaved designs they can choose (Fun drawings)
